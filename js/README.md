# BluefinDecryptxP2pe JavaScript SDK



The JavaScript SDK for the BluefinDecryptxP2pe API — an entity-oriented client with full async/await support.

The API is exposed as capitalised, semantic **Entities** — e.g.
`client.Attestation()` — each with a small set of operations (`list`, `load`, `create`, `update`, `remove`)
instead of raw URL paths and query parameters. This keeps the surface
predictable and low-friction for both humans and AI agents.

> Other languages, the CLI, and MCP server live alongside this one — see
> the [top-level README](../README.md).


## Install
```js
npm install bluefin-decryptx-p2pe
```
## Tutorial: your first API call

This tutorial walks through creating a client, listing entities, and
loading a specific record.


### Create a Client

```js
const { BluefinDecryptxP2peSDK } = require('@voxgig-sdk/bluefin-decryptx-p2pe-js')

const client = new BluefinDecryptxP2peSDK({
  apikey: process.env.BLUEFIN_DECRYPTX_P2PE_APIKEY,
})
```

### Load an Attestation

```js
const attestation = await client.Attestation().load({ id: 'attestation_id' })
console.log(attestation)
```

### List Attestation Records

```js
const attestations = await client.Attestation().list({ client: "example" })
for (const attestation of attestations) {
  console.log(attestation)
}
```

### Create a Attestation

```js
const created = await client.Attestation().create({
  client: {},
  completeDate: 'example_completeDate',
})
console.log(created)
```

### Direct API Access

Use `client.direct()` to call any API endpoint directly:

```js
const result = await client.direct({
  path: '/custom/endpoint/{id}',
  method: 'GET',
  params: { id: 'abc123' },
})

if (result.ok) {
  console.log(result.data)
}
```


## Error handling

Entity operations reject on failure, so wrap them in `try` / `catch`:

```ts
try {
  const devicetypes = await client.DeviceType().list()
  console.log(devicetypes)
} catch (err) {
  console.error('list failed:', err)
}
```

The low-level `direct()` method does **not** throw — it returns the
value or an `Error`, so check the result before using it:

```ts
const result = await client.direct({
  path: '/api/resource/{id}',
  method: 'GET',
  params: { id: 'example_id' },
})

if (result instanceof Error) {
  throw result
}
```


## How-to guides

### Make a direct HTTP request

For endpoints not covered by entity methods:

```js
const result = await client.direct({
  path: '/api/resource/{id}',
  method: 'GET',
  params: { id: 'example' },
})

if (result instanceof Error) {
  throw result
}
if (result.ok) {
  console.log(result.status)  // 200
  console.log(result.data)    // response body
}
```

### Prepare a request without sending it

```js
const fetchdef = await client.prepare({
  path: '/api/resource/{id}',
  method: 'DELETE',
  params: { id: 'example' },
})

// Inspect before sending
console.log(fetchdef.url)
console.log(fetchdef.method)
console.log(fetchdef.headers)
```

### Use test mode

Create a mock client for unit testing — no server required:

```js
const client = BluefinDecryptxP2peSDK.test()

const devicetype = await client.DeviceType().list()
// devicetype is the entity, populated with mock response data
// — call devicetype.data() for the record itself
console.log(devicetype)
```

You can also use the instance method:

```js
const client = new BluefinDecryptxP2peSDK({ apikey: '...' })
const testClient = client.tester()
```

### Retain entity state across calls

Entity instances remember their last match and data:

```js
const entity = client.DeviceType()

// First call runs the operation and stores its result
await entity.list()

// Subsequent calls reuse the stored state
const data = entity.data()
console.log(data.id)
```

### Add custom middleware

Pass features via the `extend` option:

```js
const logger = {
  hooks: {
    PreRequest: (ctx) => {
      console.log('Requesting:', ctx.spec.method, ctx.spec.path)
    },
    PreResponse: (ctx) => {
      console.log('Status:', ctx.out.request?.status)
    },
  },
}

const client = new BluefinDecryptxP2peSDK({
  apikey: '...',
  extend: [logger],
})
```

### Run live tests

Create a `.env.local` file at the project root:

```
BLUEFIN_DECRYPTX_P2PE_TEST_LIVE=TRUE
BLUEFIN_DECRYPTX_P2PE_APIKEY=<your-key>
```

Then run:

```bash
cd js && npm test
```

### Entity interface

All entities share the same interface.

#### Methods

| Method | Signature | Description |

| `entopts` | `entopts(): object` | Return a copy of the entity options. |

#### Return values

Entity operations resolve to the entity data directly — there is no
result envelope:

- `load`, `create` and `update` resolve to a single entity object.
- `list` resolves to an **array** of entity objects (iterate it directly;
  there is no `.data` and no `.ok`).
- `remove` resolves to `undefined`.

On a failed request these methods **throw**, so wrap calls in
`try`/`catch` to handle errors. Only `direct()` returns the result
envelope described below.

### DirectResult shape

The `direct()` method returns:

```js
{
  ok: true,
  status: 200,
  headers: {},
  data: {}
}
```

On error, `ok` is `false` and an `err` property contains the error.

### FetchDef shape

The `prepare()` method returns:

```js
{
  url: 'string',
  method: 'string',
  headers: {},
  body: undefined
}
```

## Features

This SDK ships 11 optional features. Each is **inactive until you
switch it on**, so an SDK you have not configured behaves exactly as if none of
them existed — no retries, no cache, no logging, no measurable overhead.

Activate a feature by name in the client options, alongside the options shown
above:

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`audit`](#audit) | Structured audit trail of operations |
| [`clienttrack`](#clienttrack) | Client identity and per-request correlation headers |
| [`idempotency`](#idempotency) | Idempotency keys for safe retries of mutating operations |
| [`log`](#log) | Structured request and response logging |
| [`metrics`](#metrics) | Statistics capture: per-operation counters and latency |
| [`paging`](#paging) | Pagination signals for list operations |
| [`ratelimit`](#ratelimit) | Client-side rate limiting via a token bucket |
| [`retry`](#retry) | Automatic retry of transient failures with exponential backoff |
| [`telemetry`](#telemetry) | Distributed tracing spans with W3C trace-context propagation |
| [`test`](#test) | In-memory mock transport for testing without a live server |
| [`timeout`](#timeout) | Per-request timeout with transport abort |

> **Order matters for `ratelimit`, `retry`, `timeout`.** These wrap the
> transport, so each one wraps whatever is already installed: the order you
> activate them in IS the nesting order. Activating them as an ordered list
> rather than a map is what fixes that order.

| `active` | `true` |

Set `feature.log.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

### metrics

Statistics capture: per-operation counters and latency.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |

Set `feature.metrics.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

### paging

Pagination signals for list operations.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `afterVar` | `'after'` |
| `cursorParam` | `'cursor'` |
| `firstVar` | `'first'` |
| `limitParam` | `'limit'` |
| `pageParam` | `'page'` |
| `startPage` | `1` |

Set `feature.paging.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

### ratelimit

Client-side rate limiting via a token bucket.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `burst` | `5` |
| `rate` | `5` |

Set `feature.ratelimit.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

`ratelimit` wraps the transport, so its position among the other
transport features decides what it sees. A feature activated later wraps one
activated earlier.

### retry

Automatic retry of transient failures with exponential backoff.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `factor` | `2` |
| `maxDelay` | `2000` |
| `minDelay` | `50` |
| `retries` | `2` |
| `statuses` | `[408, 425, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504]` |

Set `feature.retry.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

`retry` wraps the transport, so its position among the other
transport features decides what it sees. A feature activated later wraps one
activated earlier.

### telemetry

Distributed tracing spans with W3C trace-context propagation.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |

Set `feature.telemetry.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

### test

In-memory mock transport for testing without a live server.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |

Set `feature.test.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

### timeout

Per-request timeout with transport abort.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `ms` | `30000` |

Set `feature.timeout.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

`timeout` wraps the transport, so its position among the other
transport features decides what it sees. A feature activated later wraps one
activated earlier.


## Advanced

> The sections above cover everyday use. The material below explains the
> SDK's internals — useful when extending it with custom features, but not

### The operation pipeline

Every entity operation follows a six-stage pipeline. Each stage fires a
feature hook before executing:

```
PrePoint → PreSpec → PreRequest → PreResponse → PreResult → PreDone
```

- **PrePoint**: Resolves which API endpoint to call based on the
  operation name and entity configuration.
- **PreSpec**: Builds the HTTP spec — URL, method, headers, body —
  from the resolved point and the caller's parameters.
- **PreRequest**: Sends the HTTP request. Features can intercept here
  to replace the transport (as TestFeature does with mocks).
- **PreResponse**: Parses the raw HTTP response.
- **PreResult**: Extracts the business data from the parsed response.
- **PreDone**: Final stage before returning to the caller. Entity
  state (match, data) is updated here.

If any stage errors, the pipeline short-circuits and the error surfaces
to the caller — see [Error handling](#error-handling) for how that looks
in this language.

### Features and hooks

Features are the extension mechanism. A feature is an object with a
`hooks` map. Each hook key is a pipeline stage name, and the value is
a function that receives the context.

The SDK ships with built-in features:

- **AuditFeature**: Structured audit trail of operations
- **ClienttrackFeature**: Client identity and per-request correlation headers
- **IdempotencyFeature**: Idempotency keys for safe retries of mutating operations
- **LogFeature**: Structured request and response logging
- **MetricsFeature**: Statistics capture: per-operation counters and latency
- **PagingFeature**: Pagination signals for list operations
- **RatelimitFeature**: Client-side rate limiting via a token bucket
- **RetryFeature**: Automatic retry of transient failures with exponential backoff
- **TelemetryFeature**: Distributed tracing spans with W3C trace-context propagation
- **TestFeature**: In-memory mock transport for testing without a live server
- **TimeoutFeature**: Per-request timeout with transport abort

Features are initialized in order. Hooks fire in the order features
were added, so later features can override earlier ones.

### Module structure

```
bluefin-decryptx-p2pe/
├── src/
│   ├── BluefinDecryptxP2peSDK.js        # Main SDK class
│   ├── entity/             # Entity implementations
│   ├── feature/            # Built-in features (Base, Test, Log)
│   └── utility/            # Utility functions
└── test/                   # Test suites
```

Import the SDK from the package root:

```js
const { BluefinDecryptxP2peSDK } = require('@voxgig-sdk/bluefin-decryptx-p2pe-js')
```

### Entity state

Entity instances are stateful. After a successful `list`, the entity
stores the returned data and match criteria internally. Subsequent
calls on the same instance can rely on this state.

```ts
const devicetype = client.DeviceType()
await devicetype.list()

// devicetype.data() now returns the devicetype data from the last `list`
// devicetype.match() returns the last match criteria
```

Call `make()` to create a fresh instance with the same configuration
but no stored state.

### Direct vs entity access

The entity interface handles URL construction, parameter placement,
and response parsing automatically. Use it for standard CRUD operations.

The `direct` method gives full control over the HTTP request. Use it
for non-standard endpoints, bulk operations, or any path not modelled
as an entity. The `prepare` method is useful for debugging — it
shows exactly what `direct` would send.
