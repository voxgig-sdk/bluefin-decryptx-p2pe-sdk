makeClient :: IO Sdk.Client
makeClient = do
  opts <- jo [("base", VStr "https://api.example.com")]
  Sdk.newSdk opts
```

Features are activated via the `feature` option:

```haskell
  active <- jo [("active", VBool True)]
  featureCfg <- jo
    [ ("audit", active)
    , ("clienttrack", active)
    , ("idempotency", active)
    , ("log", active)
    , ("metrics", active)
    , ("paging", active)
    , ("ratelimit", active)
    , ("retry", active)
    , ("telemetry", active)
    , ("test", active)
    , ("timeout", active)
    ]
  opts <- jo [("feature", featureCfg)]
  client <- Sdk.newSdk opts
