# BluefinDecryptxP2pe Clojure SDK



The Clojure SDK for the BluefinDecryptxP2pe API — an entity-oriented client
following idiomatic Clojure conventions (plain functions, immutable data, and
the vendored `voxgig.struct` value model).

The SDK exposes the API as capitalised, semantic **Entities** — for example `(api/attestation client nil)` — each
carrying a small, uniform set of operations (`list`, `load`, `create`, `update`, `remove`) instead of raw URL
paths and query strings. You work with named resources and verbs, which
keeps the cognitive load low.

> Other languages, the CLI, and MCP server live alongside this one — see
> the [top-level README](../README.md).


## Install
This package is not yet published to Clojars. Depend on it directly from the
GitHub release tag (`clojure/vX.Y.Z`, see [Releases](https://github.com/voxgig-sdk/bluefin-decryptx-p2pe-sdk/releases)),
using a `tools.deps` git dependency:

```clojure
;; deps.edn
{:deps {bluefindecryptxp2pe/sdk
        {:git/url "https://github.com/voxgig-sdk/bluefin-decryptx-p2pe-sdk"
         :git/tag "clojure/vX.Y.Z"
         :git/sha "..."
         :deps/root "clojure"}}}
```

Or from a local source checkout:

```clojure
;; deps.edn
{:deps {bluefindecryptxp2pe/sdk {:local/root "../clojure"}}}
```


## Tutorial: your first API call

This tutorial walks through creating a client, listing entities, and
loading a specific record.

### 1. Create a client

```clojure
(require '[sdk.api :as api]
         '[sdk.entity.attestation :as e-attestation]
         '[sdk.entity.device_custody_detail :as e-device_custody_detail]
         '[voxgig.struct :as vs])

(def client (api/make-sdk (vs/jm "apikey" (System/getenv "BLUEFIN_DECRYPTX_P2PE_APIKEY"))))
```

### 2. List attestation records

`list` returns a vector of records (each a map) and raises on error —
iterate it directly.

```clojure
(try
  (doseq [attestation (e-attestation/list (api/attestation client nil) nil nil)]
    (println attestation))
  (catch Exception err
    (println "list failed:" (.getMessage err))))
```

### 3. Load a device_custody_detail

DeviceCustodyDetail is nested under device_type, so provide the
`device_type`. `load` returns the bare record (a map) and raises on error.

```clojure
(try
  (let [device_custody_detail (e-device_custody_detail/load (api/device_custody_detail client nil) (vs/jm "device_type" "example_device_type" "serial_number" "example_serial_number" "id" "example_id") nil)]
    (println device_custody_detail))
  (catch Exception err
    (println "load failed:" (.getMessage err))))
```

### 4. Create, update, and remove

```clojure
;; Create — returns the bare created record (a map)
(def created (e-attestation/create (api/attestation client nil) (vs/jm "client" (vs/jm) "completeDate" "example_completeDate") nil))

```


## Error handling

Entity operations reject on failure, so wrap them in `try` / `catch`:

```ts
try {
  const devicetypes = await client.DeviceType().list()
  console.log(devicetypes)
} catch (err) {
  console.error('list failed:', err)
}
```

The low-level `direct()` method does **not** throw — it returns the
value or an `Error`, so check the result before using it:

```ts
const result = await client.direct({
  path: '/api/resource/{id}',
  method: 'GET',
  params: { id: 'example_id' },
})

if (result instanceof Error) {
  throw result
}
```


## How-to guides

### Make a direct HTTP request

For endpoints not covered by entity operations:

```clojure
(def result
  (api/direct client
    (vs/jm "path" "/api/resource/{id}"
           "method" "GET"
           "params" (vs/jm "id" "example"))))

(if (vs/getprop result "ok")
  (do
    (println (vs/getprop result "status"))  ;; 200
    (println (vs/getprop result "data")))   ;; response body
  ;; A non-2xx response carries status + data (the error body); a
  ;; transport-level failure carries err instead. Only one is present.
  (println (vs/getprop result "status") (vs/getprop result "err")))
```

### Prepare a request without sending it

```clojure
;; prepare returns the fetch definition and raises on error.
(def fetchdef
  (api/prepare client
    (vs/jm "path" "/api/resource/{id}"
           "method" "DELETE"
           "params" (vs/jm "id" "example"))))

(println (vs/getprop fetchdef "url"))
(println (vs/getprop fetchdef "method"))
(println (vs/getprop fetchdef "headers"))
```

### Use test mode

Create a mock client for unit testing — no server required:

```clojure
(require '[sdk.api :as api]
         '[sdk.entity.device_type :as e-device_type]
         '[voxgig.struct :as vs])

(def client (api/test-sdk nil nil))

;; Entity ops return the bare record and raise on error.
(def device_type (e-device_type/list (api/device_type client nil) nil nil))
;; device_type contains the mock response record
(println device_type)
```

### Use a custom fetch function

Replace the HTTP transport with your own function. A fetch fn takes the
URL and fetch definition and returns a `[response err]` pair; `response`
is a struct map carrying `status`, `headers`, and a `json` thunk:

```clojure
(defn mock-fetch [url fetchdef]
  [(vs/jm "status" 200
          "statusText" "OK"
          "headers" (vs/jm)
          "json" (fn [] (vs/jm "id" "mock01")))
   nil])

(def client
  (api/make-sdk
    (vs/jm "base" "http://localhost:8080"
           "system" (vs/jm "fetch" mock-fetch))))
```

### Run the test suite

The generated suite (pipeline, features, netsim, primary utility and the
vendored struct corpus) runs offline through a single `tools.deps` entry
point:

```bash
cd clojure && make test
```

To exercise the SDK against the live API, construct a client with real
credentials and call its operations directly.


## Reference

### make-sdk

```clojure
(require '[sdk.api :as api]
         '[voxgig.struct :as vs])

(def client (api/make-sdk options))
```

Creates a new SDK client. `options` is a `voxgig.struct` map (or `nil`).

| Option | Type | Description |

| `base` | `string` | Base URL of the API server. |
| `prefix` | `string` | URL path prefix prepended to all requests. |
| `suffix` | `string` | URL path suffix appended to all requests. |
| `feature` | `map` | Feature activation flags. |
| `extend` | `vector` | Additional feature atoms to load. |
| `system` | `map` | System overrides (e.g. custom `fetch` fn). |

### test-sdk

```clojure
(def client (api/test-sdk testopts sdkopts))
```

Creates a test-mode client with mock transport. Both arguments may be `nil`.

| `get-utility` | `(client) -> utility` | Copy of the SDK utility object. |
| `prepare` | `(client fetchargs) -> map` | Build an HTTP request definition without sending. Raises on error. |
| `direct` | `(client fetchargs) -> map` | Build and send an HTTP request. Returns a result map (branch on `ok`). |
| `attestation` | `(client data) -> Attestation entity` | Create an Attestation entity instance. |
| `client` | `(client data) -> Client entity` | Create a Client entity instance. |
| `create_result` | `(client data) -> CreateResult entity` | Create a CreateResult entity instance. |

| `update_result` | `(client data) -> UpdateResult entity` | Create an UpdateResult entity instance. |
| `user` | `(client data) -> User entity` | Create an User entity instance. |

### Entity interface

All entities share the same interface. Operations are functions in the
entity namespace (`sdk.entity.<name>`); state accessors are stored on the
entity map and are called via keyword lookup.

| Member | Signature | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `load` | `(ent reqmatch ctrl) -> map` | Load a single entity by match criteria. Raises on error. |
| `list` | `(ent reqmatch ctrl) -> vector` | List entities matching the criteria. Raises on error. |
| `create` | `(ent reqdata ctrl) -> map` | Create a new entity. Raises on error. |
| `update` | `(ent reqdata ctrl) -> map` | Update an existing entity. Raises on error. |
| `remove` | `(ent reqmatch ctrl) -> map` | Remove an entity. Raises on error. |
| `:data-get` | `() -> map` | Get entity data. |
| `:data-set` | `(data)` | Set entity data. |
| `:match-get` | `() -> map` | Get entity match criteria. |
| `:match-set` | `(match)` | Set entity match criteria. |
| `:make` | `() -> entity` | Create a new instance with the same options. |
| `:get-name` | `() -> string` | Return the entity name. |

State accessors are called by looking up the fn and applying it, e.g.
`((:data-get ent))` or `((:data-set ent) (vs/jm "k" "v"))`.

### Result shape

Entity operations return the bare result data (a `map` for single-entity
ops, a `vector` for `list`) and raise (via `ex-info`) on error. Wrap
calls in `try`/`catch` to handle failures.

The `direct` escape hatch never raises — it returns a result `map` you
branch on via `(vs/getprop result "ok")`:

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ok` | `boolean` | `true` if the HTTP status is 2xx. |
| `status` | `long` | HTTP status code. |
| `headers` | `map` | Response headers. |
| `data` | `any` | Parsed JSON response body. |

On error, `ok` is `false` and `err` contains the error value.

## Features

This SDK ships 11 optional features. Each is **inactive until you
switch it on**, so an SDK you have not configured behaves exactly as if none of
them existed — no retries, no cache, no logging, no measurable overhead.

Activate a feature by name in the client options, alongside the options shown
above:

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`audit`](#audit) | Structured audit trail of operations |
| [`clienttrack`](#clienttrack) | Client identity and per-request correlation headers |
| [`idempotency`](#idempotency) | Idempotency keys for safe retries of mutating operations |
| [`log`](#log) | Structured request and response logging |
| [`metrics`](#metrics) | Statistics capture: per-operation counters and latency |
| [`paging`](#paging) | Pagination signals for list operations |
| [`ratelimit`](#ratelimit) | Client-side rate limiting via a token bucket |
| [`retry`](#retry) | Automatic retry of transient failures with exponential backoff |
| [`telemetry`](#telemetry) | Distributed tracing spans with W3C trace-context propagation |
| [`test`](#test) | In-memory mock transport for testing without a live server |
| [`timeout`](#timeout) | Per-request timeout with transport abort |

> **Order matters for `ratelimit`, `retry`, `timeout`.** These wrap the
> transport, so each one wraps whatever is already installed: the order you
> activate them in IS the nesting order. Activating them as an ordered list
> rather than a map is what fixes that order.

### audit

Structured audit trail of operations.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `actor` | `'anonymous'` |
| `max` | `1000` |

Set `feature.audit.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

### clienttrack

Client identity and per-request correlation headers.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `clientVersion` | `'0.0.1'` |

Set `feature.clienttrack.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

### idempotency

Idempotency keys for safe retries of mutating operations.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `header` | `'Idempotency-Key'` |
| `methods` | `['POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE']` |
| `ops` | `['create', 'update', 'remove']` |

Set `feature.idempotency.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

### log

Structured request and response logging.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `true` |

Set `feature.log.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

### metrics

Statistics capture: per-operation counters and latency.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |

Set `feature.metrics.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

### paging

Pagination signals for list operations.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `afterVar` | `'after'` |
| `cursorParam` | `'cursor'` |
| `firstVar` | `'first'` |
| `limitParam` | `'limit'` |
| `pageParam` | `'page'` |
| `startPage` | `1` |

Set `feature.paging.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

### ratelimit

Client-side rate limiting via a token bucket.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `burst` | `5` |
| `rate` | `5` |

Set `feature.ratelimit.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

`ratelimit` wraps the transport, so its position among the other
transport features decides what it sees. A feature activated later wraps one
activated earlier.

### retry

Automatic retry of transient failures with exponential backoff.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `factor` | `2` |
| `maxDelay` | `2000` |
| `minDelay` | `50` |
| `retries` | `2` |
| `statuses` | `[408, 425, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504]` |

Set `feature.retry.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

`retry` wraps the transport, so its position among the other
transport features decides what it sees. A feature activated later wraps one
activated earlier.

### telemetry

Distributed tracing spans with W3C trace-context propagation.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |

Set `feature.telemetry.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

### test

In-memory mock transport for testing without a live server.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |

Set `feature.test.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

### timeout

Per-request timeout with transport abort.

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `ms` | `30000` |

Set `feature.timeout.active` to enable it, then override any of the options above.

`timeout` wraps the transport, so its position among the other
transport features decides what it sees. A feature activated later wraps one
activated earlier.


## Advanced

> The sections above cover everyday use. The material below explains the
> SDK's internals — useful when extending it with custom features, but not
> needed for normal use.

### The operation pipeline

Every entity operation follows a six-stage pipeline. Each stage fires a
feature hook before executing:

```
PrePoint → PreSpec → PreRequest → PreResponse → PreResult → PreDone
```

- **PrePoint**: Resolves which API endpoint to call based on the
  operation name and entity configuration.
- **PreSpec**: Builds the HTTP spec — URL, method, headers, body —
  from the resolved point and the caller's parameters.
- **PreRequest**: Sends the HTTP request. Features can intercept here
  to replace the transport (as TestFeature does with mocks).
- **PreResponse**: Parses the raw HTTP response.
- **PreResult**: Extracts the business data from the parsed response.
- **PreDone**: Final stage before returning to the caller. Entity
  state (match, data) is updated here.

If any stage errors, the pipeline short-circuits and the error surfaces
to the caller — see [Error handling](#error-handling) for how that looks
in this language.

### Features and hooks

Features are the extension mechanism. A feature is an object with a
`hooks` map. Each hook key is a pipeline stage name, and the value is
a function that receives the context.

The SDK ships with built-in features:

- **AuditFeature**: Structured audit trail of operations
- **ClienttrackFeature**: Client identity and per-request correlation headers
- **IdempotencyFeature**: Idempotency keys for safe retries of mutating operations
- **LogFeature**: Structured request and response logging
- **MetricsFeature**: Statistics capture: per-operation counters and latency
- **PagingFeature**: Pagination signals for list operations
- **RatelimitFeature**: Client-side rate limiting via a token bucket
- **RetryFeature**: Automatic retry of transient failures with exponential backoff
- **TelemetryFeature**: Distributed tracing spans with W3C trace-context propagation
- **TestFeature**: In-memory mock transport for testing without a live server
- **TimeoutFeature**: Per-request timeout with transport abort

Features are initialized in order. Hooks fire in the order features
were added, so later features can override earlier ones.

### Data as struct value maps

The Clojure SDK represents API data with the vendored `voxgig.struct`
value model (ordered, Java-backed maps and lists) rather than typed
records. This mirrors the dynamic nature of the API and keeps the SDK
flexible — no code generation is needed when the API schema changes.

Build request maps with `(vs/jm "k" v ...)` and lists with
`(vs/jt v ...)`; read values with `(vs/getprop m "k")`. Use
`(vs/ismap x)` to safely check that a value is a map.

### Namespace structure

```
clojure/
├── src/sdk/api.clj        -- public API namespace (entity accessors)
├── src/sdk/client.clj     -- client constructors (make-sdk, test-sdk)
├── src/sdk/config.clj     -- generated configuration
├── src/sdk/core.clj       -- core types, context and pipeline
├── src/sdk/features.clj   -- feature factory
├── src/sdk/entity/        -- entity namespaces (one per entity)
├── src/voxgig/struct.clj  -- vendored struct value library
└── test/                  -- test suites
```

Require `[sdk.api :as api]` for the public surface, and an entity
namespace (e.g. `[sdk.entity.bluefindecryptxp2pe :as e-bluefindecryptxp2pe]`)
only when you call its operations directly.

### Entity state

Entity instances are stateful. After a successful `list`, the entity
stores the returned data and match criteria internally. Subsequent
calls on the same instance can rely on this state.

```ts
const devicetype = client.DeviceType()
await devicetype.list()

// devicetype.data() now returns the devicetype data from the last `list`
// devicetype.match() returns the last match criteria
```

Call `make()` to create a fresh instance with the same configuration
but no stored state.

### Direct vs entity access

The entity interface handles URL construction, parameter placement,
and response parsing automatically. Use it for standard CRUD operations.

The `direct` method gives full control over the HTTP request. Use it
for non-standard endpoints, bulk operations, or any path not modelled
as an entity. The `prepare` method is useful for debugging — it
shows exactly what `direct` would send.
